The narrator explains that, as a young boy, he once drew a picture of a boa constrictor with an elephant digesting in its stomach; 
however, every adult who saw the picture would mistakenly interpret it as a drawing of a hat.
Whenever the narrator would try to correct this confusion, he was ultimately advised to set aside drawing and take up a more practical or mature hobby.
The narrator laments the lack of creative understanding displayed by adults.
